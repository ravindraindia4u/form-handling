                                                FORM HANDLING
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Create two identical forms with the following fields:

- Name
- Email
- password
- Mobile Number

Make two different types of requests from each form.

In form 1 use the POST method to send data and inform 2 use GET method to send data. Once the form is submitted show a thank you page which shows all the details entered by the user.

Keep in mind the following points:

- Think of it in NodeJs way. Hence, communication with the server is absolutely compulsory.
- The URL in the browser should change when the form is submitted.
- Validation of all the fields is compulsory.
- You can use any templating engine you are comfortable with
